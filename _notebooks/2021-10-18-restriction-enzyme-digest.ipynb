    "Restriction enzymes are proteins produced by bacteria that cleave DNA at specific sites along the molecule. The enzyme functions on a specific, short nucleotide sequence and cuts the DNA only at that specific site, which is known as restriction site or target sequence. In the bacterial cell, restriction enzymes cleave foreign DNA, thus eliminating infecting organisms. The activity of a restriction enzyme can be defined by its recognition site on the DNA sequence and the position relative to the recognition site, at which it cuts the DNA."
